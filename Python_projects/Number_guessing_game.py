Welcome to Number Guessing Game
          

Objective:

    The goal of the game is to guess a secret number chosen by the computer. The secret number is between 1 and 100.

How to Play:

    The computer randomly selects a secret number between 1 and 100.
    You need to guess the number by entering your guess.

Feedback:

    After each guess, the computer will tell you whether:
        Your guess is too low and you need to guess a higher number.
        Your guess is too high and you need to guess a lower number.
        You've guessed the correct number, and the game will end.

Winning the Game:

    The game ends when you correctly guess the secret number.
    The game will also tell you how many guesses it took to find the correct number.

Rules:

    The number range is between 1 and 100.
    You must enter a valid number as your guess. If you enter something other than a number, the game will prompt you to try again.
    The game continues until you guess the secret number.
